This is a simple RESTful API exercise written with Express.js, mongoDB, and mongoose. So you must have node.js and MongoDB installed to test the API

How to test the API:

2. start MongoDB
3. node server.js(run the server)
4. test the api with postman( postman requests JSON file is in the root directory)
